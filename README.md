HangFire
=========

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qejwc7kshs1q75m4)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/odinserj/hangfire)

HangFire helps to perform background jobs inside your ASP.NET application in a simple, efficient and transparent way. It allows you to define, create and process these jobs asynchronously. With this library, you can move your long running tasks out of the request processing pipeline without losing control over them:

- Mass newsletter
- Batch import from xml, csv, json
- Creation of archives
- Firing off web hooks
- Deleting users
- Building different graphs
- Image processing
- *etc.*

HangFire stores the information about jobs in the [Redis storage](http://redis.io). So, all this information is retained after restarting the application.

Installation
-------------

HangFire stores its data in the Redis server instance, so you need to install it first. To learn different options and their pros and cons, see *Redis installation* section of the [Installation page](https://github.com/odinserj/HangFire/wiki/Installation) in the documentation. But for now we'll install it using the simplest method through the NuGet Package Manager Console:

<pre style="background-color: #202020;border: 4px solid silver;border-radius: 3px;color: #E2E2E2;display: block;padding: 10px;">PM> Install-Package Redis-32</pre>

Package Manager will install the Redis binaries to the `<project-folder>\packages\redis-32.<*>\tools` folder. Just open this folder and run the `redis-server.exe` program.

Next, install the HangFire into your **ASP.NET application** using the Package Manager Console again:

<pre style="background-color: #202020;border: 4px solid silver;border-radius: 3px;color: #E2E2E2;display: block;padding: 10px;">PM> Install-Package HangFire</pre>

Configuration
--------------

During the installation of the HangFire package, the `App_Start\HangFireConfig.cs` file appears in your project. This file contains the instructions to run the HangFire Server during the start-up of your ASP.NET application with the default options. Just build your project and open the following URL in a browser:

<div style="border-radius: 0;border:solid 3px #ccc;background-color:#fcfcfc;box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #ddd inset, 1px 1px 1px #eee;padding:3px 7px;">
<span style="color: #666;">http://&lt;your-site&gt;</span>/hangfire.axd
</div>

If you see a page like this, then the configuration step is finished. Otherwise, please refer to the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/odinserj/HangFire/wiki/Installation) in the documentation.

Usage
------

HangFire consist of the four parts. The **Client** creates background jobs and places them into the **Storage**. The **Server** fetches jobs from the Storage and processes them. The **Monitor** provides the ability to see what's going on with your background jobs.

### 1. Create a job

Job is a method invocation that will be performed asynchronously on the HangFire Server side. To create a job, you need to choose a method that will be called and define arguments of this method.

The first and default job creation method is based on job queue. Queue contains jobs that will be performed in the FIFO order. To enqueue a job, call the following method.

```csharp
BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!"));
```

You can also tell HangFire to delay the performance of a job:

```csharp
BackgroundJob.Schedule(() => Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!"), TimeSpan.FromDays(1));
```

To learn more about different options of the job creation process, see the [corresponding page](https://github.com/odinserj/HangFire/wiki/Creating-jobs) in the documentation.

### 2. Start the processing

If you installed HangFire using the NuGet Package Manager, this step is already completed for you, see the `App_Start\HangFireConfig.cs` class. It contains instructions to run the HangFire Server with default options:

```csharp
var server = new AspNetBackgroundJobServer();
server.Start();
```

You can find more information about the [HangFire Server](https://github.com/odinserj/HangFire/wiki/Performing-jobs) in the documentation.

### 3. Relax

HangFire processes each job in a reliable way. Your can stop your application, kill it using task manager, shutdown your computer<sup>1</sup>, enqueue broken jobs. HangFire contains auto-retrying facilities, and you can retry failed job manually using the integrated Monitor.

So, HangFire is an ideal solution for performing background jobs in ASP.NET applications, because IIS Application Pools contain several mechanisms that can stop your application.

* Idle Time-out
* Recycling, including on configuration changes
* Rapid-Fail protection
* Application re-deployment

1) Only processing is reliable. If your storage became broken, HangFire can not do anything. To guarantee the processing of each job, you should guarantee the reliability of your storage.
